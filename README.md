### Automatic Icons for Text-Links with FontAwesome

With this litte CSS (9kb) file all textlinks inside a specified container with the class automaticon become a prefixed icon when they match one of the selectors below. You don't have to assign additional classes to the links, the icons will set automatically. The CSS-Selectors check the file extension of the linked url, parts of the content of the url and some attributes of all anchor-Tags. For the icons I used the awesome Icon-Font from [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
